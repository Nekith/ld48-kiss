Ludum Dare #26 entry, ok, let's do this !

Top-down arena shooter.

Ammos make you bigger and slower. Use them and you'll get smaller and quicker.

There's no numbers or HUD, pay attention to the blue and green stuff.

You get a score at the end. The higher it is, the better you are.

## Going technical

* Haxe
* Only Flash is targeted
